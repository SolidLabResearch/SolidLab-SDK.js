A library of helper functions for developing Solid apps in TypeScript/JavaScript.

This package is a bundle of _all_ helper functions defined in SolidLabLib.
[These functions can also be installed separately](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/SolidLabLib.js/).

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) _(1.14 or higher)_

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @solidlab/lib
```
or
```bash
$ yarn add @solidlab/lib
```

## Usage

### Obtain the identity provider

_This canonical package of this function is [`@solidlab/idp`](https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/SolidLabLib.js/tree/master/packages/idp)_

The identity provider of a WebID can be determined as follows:
```typescript
import { getIdp } from '@solidlab/lib'; // Or getIdentityProvider

await getIdp('https://rubensworks.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me');
```

If you have an authenticated Solid session object, you can determine its IDP as follows:
```typescript
const getIdpWithSession = getIdp.with({ session });

await getIdpWithSession(session.info.webId);
```

If you want to use a custom query engine instead of the default one,
make sure to use the `light` version of this package,
which enables the default query engine to be tree-shaked out during bundling:
```typescript
import { getIdp } from '@solidlab/lib/light';

const getIdpWithEngine = getIdp.with({ engine: new CustomQueryEngine() });
await getIdpWithEngine('https://rubensworks.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me');
```

If you have an authenticated Solid session object, you can determine its IDP as follows:
```typescript
await getIdp(session.info.webId, defaultSolidUtilContext(session));
```
