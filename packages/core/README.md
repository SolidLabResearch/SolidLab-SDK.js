A library of helper functions for developing Solid apps in TypeScript/JavaScript.

This package contains logic that is common to all SolidLabLib packages.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) _(1.14 or higher)_

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @solidlab/core
```
or
```bash
$ yarn add @solidlab/core
```

## Usage

### Solid Utility Context

The `SolidUtilContext` interface represents an object that can contain fields that can be used across different helper
functions within SolidLabLib.
This can contain fields such as an authenticated Solid session, and a query engine.

The easiest way to obtain such a context is as follows:
```typescript
import { defaultSolidUtilContext } from '@solidlab/core';

const context = defaultSolidUtilContext();
```

If you already have parts of the context available (such as the `session`),
you can fill in the other missing parts as follows: 
```typescript
const context = defaultSolidUtilContext({ session });
```

Alternatively, you can create your own context from scratch as long as it contains all the required fields:
```typescript
const context = {
  session, // An authenticated Solid session.
  engine, // A query engine object that can be used for finding data.
  queryContext, // A context object for passing options to the query engine during query execution.
}
```

### Helper functions

The following helper functions are available in this package:

* `getFirstBindings`: Obtains the first bindings object in a bindings stream.
* `getTermValue`: Obtain the value of the given RDF term, or throw an error if the term is undefined.
